1,Leading by Doing: Does Leading by Example Impact Productivity and Service Quality?,https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2018.0706,26 March 2020,"This paper presents a research model for the creation of organizational value through leading by example. I argue that leading by example serves as a unique value-creation driver by enhancing engagement, productivity, and service quality at the business level. Using a strategy-based resource management framework, I also argue that there are synergies between leading by example and the manifestation of organizational core values. My theory is grounded in the strategy-based notion that combining organizational resources—leading by example (practical element) and organizational core values (conceptual element)—optimizes employee engagement, which in turn enhances productivity and service quality. I examine my model empirically using two-time-point panel data derived from three different sources (employees, financial data, and secret shoppers) in a sample of 233 retail stores. The findings provide evidence that leading by example improves productivity and service quality (after taking into account the potential influence of charismatic leadership). The indirect effect of leading by example on productivity and service quality (through engagement) is even stronger where manifestation of organizational core values is high. Contributions to theory, research, and practice are presented. ",Liat Eldor,,,,,
2,"Marriage of Unequals? Investment Quality Heterogeneity, Market Heat, and the Formation of Status-Asymmetric Ties in the Venture Capital Industry",https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2018.0969,24 March 2020,"In this study, we investigate the emergence of status-asymmetric ties among venture capital firms. In particular, we highlight the venture’s performance trajectory as a powerful antecedent of upward-status asymmetries (in which a lower-status actor brings a higher-status alter into a venture) as well as downward-status asymmetries (in which a higher-status actor brings in a lower-status alter). We hypothesize that lower-status firms tend to bring higher-status alters into ventures on a better performance trajectory, whereas higher-status firms tend to bring lower-status alters into poorly performing ventures. Furthermore, we argue that these effects will be moderated by market heat, which affects whether investors would focus on the upside or downside of deals. We test our hypotheses in a longitudinal analysis of venture capital syndication patterns in the US between 1990 and 2017. We find support for most of our predictions and document that the ability of lower-status lead investors to bring higher-status followers into good ventures is particularly accentuated in hot markets, which can heighten market participants’ concerns about missing good deals. We thus highlight the interplay between the internal and the external context in shaping the formation of status-asymmetric relationships.",Pavel I. Zhelyazkov,Adam Tatarynowicz,,,,
3,Strength and Weakness in Numbers? Unpacking the Role of Prevalence in the Diffusion of Reverse Mergers,https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2018.0716,20 March 2020,"A common prediction in research on practice diffusion is a “strength in numbers” effect (i.e., that a growing number of past adopters will increase the number of future adopters). We advance and test a theoretical perspective to explain when and how practice prevalence may also generate a “weakness in numbers” effect. Specifically, in seeking to explain the diffusion of reverse mergers (RMs)—a controversial practice that allows a private firm to go public by merging with a publicly listed “shell company”—we suggest that prevalence affected their diffusion in a complex way, based on two divergent social influence pathways: (1) a direct and positive effect of practice prevalence on potential adopters, who view prevalence as evidence of the practice’s value, and (2) an indirect and negative effect, mediated through third-party evaluators (e.g., regulators, the media) who view prevalence as a cause for concern and skepticism. We also highlight the utility of this theoretical framework by analyzing how a decline in the status of past adopters exerts a negative effect on diffusion through both social influence pathways. Employing structural equation modeling techniques, we find support for the hypothesized relationships and we discuss the implications of the study for future research on practice diffusion.",Ivana Naumovska,Edward Zajac,Peggy Lee,,,
4,Deploying Human Capital Resources: Accentuating effects of situational alignment and social capital resources,https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2019.0500,18 March 2020,"Researchers and organizational leaders alike have long known that securing human capital (HC) is critical for organizational success. The bulk of research in this domain has addressed issues regarding the accrual of HC stocks. However, there has been a dearth of research that explores the underlying mechanisms through which accrued HC stocks translate to competitive advantage. We expand on Wolfson & Mathieu’s (2018) Human Capital Resource Complementarity (HCRC) theory by incorporating the deployment of HCRs as well as the role of Social Capital Resources (SCRs) in the form of members’ shared team task-specific experience in predicting performance. We empirically test HCRC theory-derived hypotheses using a sample of 448 cyclists from 17 World Teams who competed in 26 races during the 2015 season of the Union Cycliste Internationale World Tour. Our results revealed that higher-level HCR stocks indirectly led to deployed HCR performance through deployed HCR alignment with situational characteristics. Furthermore, SCRs acted as a critical boundary condition for the value of aligning deployed HCRs with situational characteristics such that the alignment of deployed HCRs was only advantageous when paired with relatively high levels of SCRs. Implications for future theory building, research, and practice related to HCR deployment are discussed.",Mikhail A Wolfson,John E Mathieu,,,,
5,Antecedents  and Consequences of Employment and Asset Restructuring,https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2018.1013,16 March 2020,"We examine two forms of employment and asset restructuring, downsizing and upsizing. Guided by institutional theory, we focus on two important questions. One, are the antecedents of restructuring common across downsizing and upsizing? Two, are the performance consequences of such restructuring related to prior firm performance? To answer these questions, we use primary data from companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange over a 37-year period (1980–2016). Our results suggest that six key antecedents play a prominent role in both downsizing and upsizing, although they differ in magnitude and direction in how they affect each form of restructuring. But, in both instances, they reflect efficiency considerations (company performance and managerial foresight) as well as institutional forces (the economy, political uncertainty, industry, and technology), just as neo-institutional theory suggests. Two, prior performance plays a central role in restructuring decisions, in both the upsizing and downsizing of assets and employees. The evidence suggests it is not just current-year performance but also the trend in company performance over the prior two years that forecasts subsequent firm performance, thereby extending and refining institutional theory.",Wayne Francis Cascio,Arjun Chatrath,Rohan A.

6,Salient Expectations? Incongruence across Capability and Integrity Signals and Investor Reactions to Organizational Misconduct,https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2018.0698,5 March 2020,"Research in signaling theory has recently begun to explore the consequences of incongruity across signals from a single source. However, attention has been directed towards the incongruity across signals along a single dimension, even though audiences evaluate firms based on signals along different dimensions. Here, we extend this theory to investigate the incongruity across signals along different dimensions. Specifically, we theorize that the salience of positive capability signals when organizational misconduct is revealed (a negative integrity signal) causes interdimensional incongruence. We argue that audiences face greater incongruity and react more negatively to misconduct by firms whose positive capability signals were more salient. Using irregular financial restatements as the negative integrity signals and alliance announcements as the positive capability signals, we find that investors react more negatively to restatements by firms whose alliance announcements were more salient. That is, firms that announced more frequently and firms that created more positive expectations from those announcements were penalized more. We also found that firm size and diversification weaken these negative effects. We contribute to research on signaling theory, organizational misconduct, and alliances.",Srikanth Paruchuri,Jung-Hoon Han,Puneet Prakash,,,
7,How Voice Emerges and Develops in Newly Formed Supervisor-Employee Dyads,https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2018.0961,5 March 2020,"We develop and test theory regarding how voice emerges and develops in newly formed supervisor-employee dyads. We propose the following: Employees with higher proactive personality speak up more in the early stages of interactions in their dyads. The subsequent path that their voice takes—that is, whether it increases in a virtuous positive trajectory or decreases in a viscous negative trajectory—is determined by whether their proactive personality is a match to their supervisors’ proactive personality. For instance, when they are paired with supervisors who are not similarly proactive, they confront low congruence on change-related goals in the working relationship; hence, rather than building off their initial voice and developing a positive voice trajectory, they might become frustrated and their voice might decay in negative trajectory. We found support for this theory in a sample of 403 newly-formed dyads. Employees with higher proactive personality were more likely to speak up to their supervisors immediately after they start working together. Congruence between the supervisors and the employees in their proactive personality predicted how voice changed in the dyads in the ensuing 6 months. Dyadic (in) congruence in proactive personality not only drove the linear (negative) positive trend in voice, but also enabled the pace of voice growth to pick up momentum and non-linearly (decelerate) accelerate over time. We discuss the implications of these findings for theory and practice.",Alex Ning Li,Subrahmaniam Tangirala,,,,
8,How Technological Overlap between Spinouts and Parent Firms Affects Corporate Venture Capital Investments in Spinouts: The Role of Competitive Tension,https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2018.0223,28 February 2020,"Drawing on the literature on entrepreneurship and competitive dynamics, we investigate how technological overlap between spinouts and parent firms influences corporate investors’ decisions regarding investments in spinouts. We suggest that a high level of technological overlap between a spinout and its parent firm deters potential corporate investors from making an investment in the spinout because of competitive tension arising from anticipated hostile actions by the parent firm. We further suggest that these negative effects are contingent on the tradeoffs between competitive risks and benefits. Our findings show that the negative effects are amplified when parent firms have a strong litigiousness in claiming their intellectual property rights. However, we find that the negative effects are mitigated when corporate investors can expect benefits from gaining indirect access to parent firms’ technological knowledge. Using a sample of corporate venture capital investments in the U.S. medical device industry, we find evidence that supports our hypotheses.",Joonhyung Bae,Joon Mahn Lee,,,,
9,"Under Trusted, Over Trusted, or Just Right? The Fairness of (In)congruence between Trust Wanted and Trust Received",https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2018.0334,13 February 2020,"The nascent literature on feeling trusted has focused on the notion that it is a benefit to employees and their organizations, with several studies demonstrating a link to improved job performance. It is not surprising, therefore, that the prevailing assumption is employees will react positively when their supervisors trust them more as opposed to less. Recent research, however, suggests the benefits of feeling trusted are accompanied by strains, which some employees may be unwilling to bear. Drawing on seminal theorizing on fairness, we propose that employees will perceive their supervisors as being more mindful of their needs—acting more fairly—when there is a fit between trust wanted and trust received, even when the fit is at low levels of trust. By extension, when trust received exceeds or falls short of an employee’s desire for trust, the employee should perceive the supervisor as less fair. We build a model in which the overall fairness perceptions resulting from the trust wanted–received interplay influence employee performance. Our model is supported by a multi-source, three-wave field study and an experiment.",Michael Baer,Emma L. Frank,Fadel K Matta,Margaret M. Luciano,,
10,CEO Temporal Focus and Behavioral Agency Theory: Evidence from Mergers and Acquisitions,https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2018.1470,11 February 2020,"The behavioral agency model (BAM) posits that executives endow current wealth, but do not endow prospective wealth. As a result of this endowment effect, executives are risk-averse with current wealth and risk-seeking with prospective wealth. These relationships, however, assume all executives perceive and attend to current and future outcomes similarly, which is at odds with psychology research on temporal perceptions. Drawing on the concept of temporal focus, we theorize that present-focused CEOs adhere to the BAM’s endowment effect, while exhibiting even stronger relationships between current and prospective wealth and risk taking. In contrast, by nature of being forward-looking, future-focused CEOs endow prospective wealth instead of current wealth, thereby reversing the main relationships of the BAM. Using a sample of 7,700 CEO-year observations from 2003 to 2016, we find empirical support for our arguments in the context of merger and acquisition (M&A) investment. Findings from this study advance the BAM model by showing the relationships between wealth types and risk-taking hinge on CEOs’ temporal focus. ",Mark R DesJardine,Wei Shi,,,,
11,Too Unsafe to Monitor? How Board–CEO Cognitive Conflict and Chair Leadership Shape Outside Director Monitoring,https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2017.1256,7 February 2020,"Research into boards of directors provides mixed support for the view that outside directors’ independence and/or leadership by an independent chair improves monitoring. In this study, we use a micro-level approach to provide a better understanding of why outside directors have difficulty in monitoring the CEO. We highlight that an important reason for this lies in the boardroom dynamics associated with (1) outside directors’ cognitive conflict with the CEO and (2) the chair’s leadership of the board. Our inductive analyses of video observations of board meetings in five Australian corporations revealed the importance of chair participative leadership during disagreement episodes in the boardroom. Follow-up in-depth interviews of board meeting participants highlighted the importance of psychological safety as a key mechanism explaining why participative board chairs appear so effective in dealing with board–CEO cognitive conflict. We corroborate these results with a second, large-scale survey study involving data on 310 outside directors from 64 Dutch boards. Whereas prior work mostly focuses on the chair’s relationship with the CEO, we instead highlight the importance of the chair’s role as the leader of the board and identify board psychological safety as an important element shaping director monitoring within the confines of the boardroom.",Dennis B.

12,"Distinguishing Voice and Silence at Work: Unique Relationships with Perceived Impact, Psychological Safety, and Burnout",https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2018.1428,7 February 2020,"Scholars continue to debate whether voice and silence are opposites or distinct constructs. This ambiguity has prevented meaningful theoretical advancements about employees’ voice and silence at work. We draw on the behavioral activation and behavioral inhibition systems perspective to provide a conceptual framework for the independence of voice and silence and explicate how two key antecedents—perceived impact and psychological safety—more strongly relate to voice and silence, respectively. We further differentiate voice and silence by identifying their unique effects on employee burnout. In Study 1, a meta-analysis, we demonstrate that voice and silence are independent (Mρ = -.15) and that perceived impact (psychological safety) relates more strongly to voice (silence) than to silence (voice). We also find that silence has a significantly stronger association with burnout compared to voice. In Study 2, we constructively replicate these findings in an interval-contingent panel study across six months. Taken together, this article shifts the conversation of whether voice and silence are distinct constructs to how they differ and why such differences matter.",Elad N.

13,Do the Hustle! Empowerment from Side-hustles and Its Effects on Full-time Work Performance,https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2018.0164,6 February 2020,"Side-hustles, income-generating work performed alongside full-time jobs, are increasingly common as the gig economy provides opportunities for employees to perform supplementary work. Although scholars suggest that side-hustles conflict with full-time work performance, we assert psychological empowerment from side-hustles enriches full-time work performance. We argue that side-hustle complexity—the motivating characteristics of side-hustles—positively relates to empowerment and that side-hustle motives moderate this relationship. A study of 337 employees supports these assertions. We then investigate spillover of side-hustle empowerment to full-time work performance in a 10-day experience-sampling method study of 80 employee-coworker dyads. We address an affective pathway in which daily side-hustle empowerment enriches full-time work performance through side-hustle engagement and positive affect at work. We also consider a cognitive pathway in which side-hustle empowerment distracts from full-time work performance through side-hustle engagement and attention residue—persistent cognitions about side-hustles during full-time work. Overall, performance enrichment from side-hustles was stronger than performance conflict. We also consider affective shift from full-time work to side-hustles, finding negative affect from full-time work strengthens the relationship between side-hustle empowerment and engagement. Combined, our two studies examine the source of side-hustle empowerment and how and why side-hustle empowerment influences affective and cognitive experiences during full-time work.",Hudson Sessions,Jennifer D Nahrgang,Manuel Vaulont,Raseana Williams,,
14,"Resource Dependence, Uncertainty, and the Allocation of Corporate Political Activity across Multiple Jurisdictions",https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2017.1258,30 January 2020,"This paper contributes to the resource dependence theory literature and corporate political activity literature by distinguishing dependence from uncertainty and explaining how two different types of uncertainty have opposite effects on dependence management. We draw on Milliken’s (1987) uncertainty typology to explain how some environmental factors increase the state uncertainty associated with firms’ dependence on government jurisdictions, whereas other factors increase response uncertainty. We hypothesize that, due to the historical influence of the media and social movement organizations (SMOs) on politics, negative national media tenor and oppositional SMO resources increase state uncertainty (i.e., government’s likely behavior toward firms becomes less predictable), strengthening the relationship between firms’ dependence on jurisdictions and their use of political contributions in those jurisdictions. Further, we hypothesize that TMT turnover and politician turnover increase response uncertainty (i.e., the effectiveness of firms’ efforts to manage their dependence becomes less clear), weakening the relationship between dependence and political contributions. We find support for our theory in an examination of state-level political contributions of firms in environmentally intensive industries from 2009 to 2016. Interviews with senior executives, political consultants, and senior government employees directly involved in corporate political activity help illustrate the hypothesized relationships.",Trey Sutton,Richard A.

15,Unpacking Firm External Dependence: How Government Contract Dependence Affects Firm Investments and Market Performance,https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2018.0067,30 January 2020,"We advance resource dependence theory (RDT) by answering calls for theorizing on both how being dependent on external entities for resources affect firms and the heterogeneous nature of such dependencies. Specifically, we develop theory about how internal firm dynamics and performance are affected by resource dependence by integrating resource orchestration (RO) theorizing into RDT. Building on RO, we argue as the degree to which a firm is dependent upon a single source of revenue increases (a core tenet of RDT), the firm adjusts internally by reducing investments and the market responds negatively as well. Further, we argue the heterogeneous nature of such dependence – namely, dependence scope (the spread of dependence throughout the entity with which the dependence relationship resides), dependence supplementation (the addition of new relationships within the prior dependence relationship), and dependence stability (the expected length of the dependence relationship) – moderates the relationship between level of dependence and these outcomes. We find broad support for our theorizing in a longitudinal sample of manufacturing firms’ dependence upon governmental contracts for revenue. Collectively, we advance understanding of RDT by adding nuance to both explanatory mechanisms underlying dependence and conceptualizations of a firm’ external dependence relationships, posing theoretical and practical implications.

16,The Two Towers (or Somewhere in Between): The Behavioral Consequences of Positional Inconsistency across Status Hierarchies,https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2018.1091,30 January 2020,"We examine how actors react to status inconsistencies across multiple status hierarchies. We argue that pluralistic value systems create multiple status conferral mechanisms, and that hierarchies’ prestige varies as a function of the values they represent. While status inconsistency, in general, increases the likelihood that actors will pursue opportunities that can boost their lagging status, their status hierarchies’ unequal prestige influences the magnitude and direction of actors’ responses to their status inconsistency. Further, their ability to do so is constrained by their relative standing in their primary status hierarchy and the extent to which they are embedded in particular professional networks. Using the artistic and commercial status of Hollywood performers, we found that status-inconsistent performers were more likely to appear in films that could boost their lagging status in the commercial hierarchy when they possessed relatively higher artistic than commercial status. Moreover, being high-status decreased the likelihood a performer would pursue opportunities that could improve their lagging status only when they were high status in the artistic status hierarchy, while embeddedness only decreased the likelihood when their primary status hierarchy was commercial.",Jung-Hoon Han,Tim Pollock,,,,
17,When Does Pay for Performance Motivate Employee Helping Behavior? The Contextual Influence of Performance Subjectivity,https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2018.1408,28 January 2020,"An extensive body of literature demonstrates the incentive effect by which pay for performance (PFP) motivates employees’ in-role task performance. Nonetheless, scholars have also posited that PFP is likely to demotivate employees’ extra-role behaviors. Drawing upon expectancy theory (Vroom, 1964) and the heuristic processing literature (Kahneman, 2011), we examine the relationship between PFP and employee helping behavior. We perform this examination not only by considering the “pay” component (e.g., PFP intensity) but also by scrutinizing the “performance” component, namely, performance subjectivity, which refers to the extent to which the criteria or indicators used to measure employee performance in the performance appraisal system are subjective. Specifically, we propose that PFP has a conditional positive effect (i.e., in the context of high performance subjectivity) on employee helping behavior and further theorize and test the underlying psychological mechanism by which individual perceived helping-performance expectancy accounts for the interactive effects between PFP and performance subjectivity on employee helping behavior. The empirical results of three studies employing distinctive methodologies provide general support for our hypotheses. Taken together, our research challenges the conventional wisdom that PFP undermines employees’ extra-role behaviors by providing new insight into understanding when and why PFP motivates employee helping behavior.",Wei He,Shao-Long Li,Jie Feng,Guanglei Zhang,,
18,"Maintaining Strategic Ambiguity for Protection: Struggles over Opacity, Equivocality, and Absurdity around the Sicilian Mafia",https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2017.1086,21 January 2020,"In spite of an increasing interest in ambiguity, our knowledge of how organizations maintain strategic ambiguity to protect themselves from public scrutiny is still in its infancy. Through an in-depth historical study of the Sicilian Mafia between 1963 and 2018, we develop a model of strategic ambiguity maintenance. We focus on three struggles between the Mafia and state representatives and show how they centered on different types of ambiguity: ambiguity as opacity, equivocality and absurdity. We elaborate on the strategies enacted by the Mafia and the responses by state representatives and their implications for ambiguity over time. The main contribution of our paper is that it advances understanding of the maintenance of strategic ambiguity by organizations that need to protect themselves from public scrutiny. More specifically, it enriches understanding of the key process dynamics, the type of struggles, and the discursive and non-discursive strategies employed in the process. Our analysis also extends research on clandestine organizations and illuminates the relationship between (strategic) ambiguity and secrecy.",Giulia Cappellaro,Amelia Compagni,Eero Vaara,,,
19,Gaining Legitimacy by Being Different: Optimal Distinctiveness in Crowdfunding Platforms,https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2018.0620,21 January 2020,"How do new ventures gain legitimacy and attract critical resources? An increasing body of cultural entrepreneurship research highlights an “optimal distinctiveness” trade-off: new ventures need to be distinctive from their peers to stand out, yet distinctiveness counteracts the attainment of organizational legitimacy. In this paper, we challenge the underlying assumption that distinctiveness necessarily counteracts the attainment of legitimacy and propose that distinctiveness can become a source of legitimacy. This proposition matters because it fundamentally alters the relationship between distinctiveness and resource acquisition from certain audiences. We build on these theoretical arguments to examine new ventures’ resource acquisition from crowdfunders, one of the most important audiences for new ventures. Analysis of 28,425 crowdfunding campaigns across 39 market categories strongly supports our arguments, showing that higher levels of distinctiveness lead to superior crowdfunding performance. We further demonstrate that the legitimating effect of distinctiveness intensifies under the absence of alternative sources of legitimacy. Our study contributes by uncovering a new mechanism and three contingencies for the “optimal distinctiveness” trade-off.",Karl Taeuscher,Ricarda B. Bouncken,Robin Pesch,,,
20,Kin Ties and the Performance of New Firms: A Structural Approach,https://journals.aom.org/doi/10.5465/amj.2017.1218,16 January 2020,"Kin ties are all but ubiquitous in new firms. However, their effects on performance are not straightforward, because they may provide new firms with advantages (enhanced coordination and cooperation) as well as disadvantages (reduced diversity, nepotism concerns, and the possible spillover of personal conflict). As kin ties may have both positive and negative implications for performance, a contingency approach to the performance of new firms is valuable. We develop such an approach by relating different structural configurations of kin ties – whether they are between founders, between founders and employees, and between employees – to the performance of new firms. We test our predictions using data on 4,967 new firms founded in Stockholm between 1998 and 2003. Our theory deepens our understanding of why kin ties have heterogeneous effects on the performance of new firms.",Gokhan Ertug,Reddi Kotha,Peter Hedstrom,,,
21,"Authenticity at work: Its shapes, triggers, and consequences",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.obhdp.2020.01.010,13 March 2020,"The concept of authenticity has been increasingly on the scholarly radar. While conceptualized in numerous ways, authenticity has been suggested to include some form of alignment of one’s internal sense of self (e.g., beliefs, values, motivations) and the external expression of it. State or felt authenticity has been defined as the sense of being one’s real self. Much evidence highlights the positive consequences of authenticity, both in general and at work. Yet, many questions remain. This special section consists of four articles that theorize and provide novel empirical evidence, including experiments and field studies, on antecedents and consequences of authenticity in the work context. The articles focus on behavioral, felt, and perceived authenticity, document intrapersonal and situational factors triggering authenticity. Moreover, the articles lay the foundation for novel research directions, integrating concepts such as identity integration, humility, and power into the authenticity at work discourse.","Patricia Faison Hewlin, Natalia Karelaia, Maryam Kouchaki, Constantine Sedikides",,,,,
22,To be or not to be your authentic self? Catering to others’ preferences hinders performance,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.obhdp.2020.01.003,31 January 2020,"When approaching interpersonal first meetings (e.g., job interviews), people often cater to the target’s interests and expectations to make a good impression and secure a positive outcome such as being offered the job (pilot study). This strategy is distinct from other approaches identified in prior impression management research (Studies 1A, 1B and 1C), and does not produce the benefits people expect. In a field study in which entrepreneurs pitched their ideas to potential investors (Study 2), catering harmed investors’ evaluations, while being authentic improved them. People experience greater anxiety and instrumentality when they cater to another person’s preferences than when they behave authentically (Studies 3A and 3B). Compared to behaving authentically or to a control condition, catering harms performance because trying to anticipate and fulfill others’ preferences feels instrumental and increases anxiety (Studies 4 and 5). Taken together, these results suggest that although people believe using catering in interpersonal first meetings will lead to successful outcomes, the opposite is true: catering creates undesirable feelings of instrumentality for the caterer, increases anxiety, and ultimately hinders performance.","Francesca Gino, Ovul Sezer, Laura Huang",,,,,
23,Does being mindful make people more creative at work? The role of creative process engagement and perceived leader humility,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.obhdp.2019.12.003,23 January 2020,"An emerging line of research in the mindfulness literature is to examine the role of mindfulness in creativity in organizations. Thus far, little is known about how and when mindfulness, defined as present-moment attention, is associated with employee creativity. We theorize and test a model that links mindfulness to employee creativity through creative process engagement. We further suggest and test perceived leader humility as a boundary condition for such an association. The results of two field studies with time-lagged designs provide supporting evidence for our conceptual model. Specifically, the findings from both studies indicate that employee mindfulness has a positive association with supervisor-rated employee creativity through employee creative process engagement. In our second study, we also find that the indirect positive association between mindfulness and employee creativity (via creative process engagement) is strengthened when employees perceive their supervisors to be humble leaders. In contrast, the conditional indirect relationship is statistically nonsignificant under the condition of low perceived leader humility.","Siu Yin Cheung, Emily G. Huang, Song Chang, Liqun Wei",,,,,
24,"Wherever you go, there you become: How mindfulness arises in everyday situations",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.obhdp.2019.11.008,9 January 2020,"In this article, we suggest that mindfulness is not something entirely inherent within people but is partly elicited and shaped by situations. Integrating research on metacognitive practice and self-regulation, we introduce a theoretical framework that explains how mindfulness arises based on capacity for self-regulation as well as three motivational forces: metacognitive beliefs that drive resources into self-regulation, mental fatigue that draws resources away from self-regulation, and situational appraisals that influence how much self-regulation is needed to maintain mindfulness. Across three experience sampling studies that include 558 participants and 9,390 responses, we find that: mindfulness depends less on people’s overall capacity for self-regulation than it does on the metacognitive beliefs that motivate them to allocate their resources, these metacognitive beliefs can compensate for the negative role of mental fatigue, and situations can influence mindfulness both by pulling attention toward tasks (e.g., with challenging tasks) and away from them (e.g., with organizational hindrances). In sum, this article clarifies the understudied antecedents of mindfulness through a theoretical framework and empirical findings.","Christopher S. Reina, Ravi S. Kudesia",,,,,

We conducted a field experiment of a social recognition intervention to improve record keeping in health facilities in two Nigerian states, replicating the intervention – implemented by a single organization – on bureaucrats performing identical tasks. Social recognition improved performance in one state but had no effect in the other, highlighting both the potential benefits and also the sometimes-limited generalizability of behavioral interventions. Furthermore, differences in facility-level observables did not explain cross-state differences in impacts, suggesting that it may often be difficult to predict external validity.","Varun Gauri, Julian C.

26,Using behavioral insights to increase attendance at subsidized preschool programs: The Show Up to Grow Up intervention,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.obhdp.2019.11.002,2 December 2019,"We implemented a field experiment called Show Up to Grow Up designed to increase attendance and diminish chronic absences at subsidized preschool programs in Chicago. We sent personalized text messages to parents targeting malleable factors that potentially drive absences from preschool. Using administrative records from preschools, we find that the intervention increased attended days by 2.5 (0.15 standard deviations) and decreased chronic absenteeism by 9.3 percentage points (20%) over an 18-week period. Our results suggest that the treatment impact is stronger among those in the bottom quantiles of the attendance distribution. Survey data collected at baseline suggest that our intervention made the importance of preschool more salient to parents who initially reported lower expectations for attendance and weaker beliefs about the importance of attendance to their children’s development. Preschool centers may save resources by implementing low-cost light-touch interventions to meet attendance requirements.","Ariel Kalil, Susan E. Mayer, Sebastian Gallegos",,,,,
27,Free-riding and cost-bearing in discrimination,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.obhdp.2019.08.003,29 November 2019,"We study how the temporal positions in which a disadvantaged person (e.g., an unattractive-looking customer) and an advantaged person (e.g., an attractive-looking customer) encounter an actor (e.g., a vendor) influence the treatment they get from the actor (e.g., the prices the vendor offers). Three experiments, including a field experiment and a pre-registered experiment, incorporate three types of personal attributes (physical appearance, nationality, and gender) and find both a  for the disadvantaged person and a  for the advantaged person. Specifically, the disadvantaged person receives better treatment by following the advantaged person, and the advantaged person receives worse treatment by following the disadvantaged person. These effects occur only if the attribute that differentiates the disadvantaged and advantaged persons is perceived as unjustifiable, and they disappear if the attribute is perceived as justifiable, suggesting that these effects are due not to anchoring, but to the actor’s need for justifiability. This research highlights the importance of choice architecture in discrimination and its prevention.","Xilin Li, Christopher K. Hsee",,,,,
28,Mind your own break! The interactive effect of workday respite activities and mindfulness on employee outcomes via affective linkages,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.obhdp.2019.11.001,14 November 2019,"Workday respite activities are supposed to be beneficial for employees due to their intended relaxing and enjoyable nature, but employees may find it difficult to agilely switch their awareness and attention between work tasks and respite activities during work hours. Based on affective events and mindfulness-to-meaning theories, we propose workday respite activities as affective events and identify mindfulness—the exercise of non-judgmental awareness and attention to the present moment—as a moderator that facilitates psychological detachment from work during workday respite activities, which in turn enhances employee outcomes later in the day via affective states. Our results from three experience-sampling studies with full-time employees indicate that engaging in workday respite activities is indirectly and positively related with intrinsic motivation and work engagement via psychological detachment and positive affective state, while negatively related with work stress and emotional exhaustion via psychological detachment and negative affective state, especially when mindfulness is higher.","SinHui Chong, You Jin Kim, Hun Whee Lee, Russell E.

29,Crafting messages to fight dishonesty: A field investigation of the effects of social norms and watching eye cues on fare evasion,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.obhdp.2019.10.003,10 November 2019,"The impact of watching eyes cues and descriptive social norm messages on fare evasion was studied in two experiments that were conducted in two railway stations in France. In Study 1, a natural field experiment, passengers were exposed for a two-week period to either a control eye-cues poster or to an experimental eye-cues with a social norm messaging campaign. In Study 2, an artefactual experiment in the field, participants in the experimental train station were asked to participate in a lying task before and after they were exposed to the messaging campaign. The results from both studies suggest that although watching eye cues alone are not effective in a crowded train station, exposing passengers to watching eye cues together with a descriptive social norm messaging campaign reduced the fare evasion rates observed by standard inspection operations, and eliminated lying behavior measured by the  paradigm. These results strengthen the external validity of laboratory experiments that have documented small scale cheating behavior and highlight the potential benefits of internal enforcement techniques to fight dishonesty in the field. In addition, they stress the advantage of combining visibility cues and social norms when orienting people toward more moral behavior.","Shahar Ayal, Jérémy Celse, Guy Hochman",,,,,
30,The valley of trust: The effect of relational strength on monitoring quality,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.obhdp.2019.07.004,26 October 2019,"Effective monitoring of firms by regulatory agencies is essential to maintaining economic sustainability, correcting information asymmetry in markets, and mitigating social and environmental externalities. Yet, monitoring failures often arise where the monitoring agent fails to detect or report infractions by the firms they monitor. Whereas organizational scholars cite weak relationships and a lack of trust between firms and monitors as a key source of monitoring failures, research in organizational deviance contends that increased trust in strong relationships promotes monitoring failures via negligence and collusion. Drawing on these two literatures, we propose that relationship strength exhibits a U-shaped relationship with monitoring quality, as mediated by trust: increasing relationship strength reduces monitoring failures to a certain point, but beyond which it increases monitoring failures. We test our theory with three studies: a field study using longitudinal archival data on financial restatements, a survey of Certified Public Accountants, and an experimental audit simulation.","Brandy Aven, Lily Morse, Alessandro Iorio",,,,,
31,"Social distance, trust and getting “hooked”: A phishing expedition",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.obhdp.2019.08.001,27 September 2019,"Phishing is a message-based computer attack sent to deceive and exploit recipients via email. Phishing is a problem for organizations because getting “hooked,” or tricked into acting on behalf of the sender, can put sensitive personal and organizational data at risk. In this research, we draw from several theoretical perspectives concerning social distance and trust as an exploitable resource to provide evidence that, even in contexts where actual social distance and intentions are nearly impossible to determine, people look to category-based signals of social distance to establish trust, which increases the likelihood of deception. We present the results of a validation study and a randomized field experiment in which we sent phishing emails to all employees of an insurance company.","Sean R. Martin, Julia J.

32,Mock meat in the butchery: Nudging consumers toward meat substitutes,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.obhdp.2019.09.004,24 September 2019,"Is it possible to nudge consumers to swap their chicken sandwich for a meat substitute? A field study tests whether adapting the choice architecture of a large retail store increases the purchase of meat substitutes among nonusers. Instead of offering meat substitutes exclusively in a separate, vegetarian section, this study places them next to similar meat products in the butchery. As such, we (1) increase the meat substitutes’ visibility and (2) offer them in pairs with their meat-based counterparts. Doing so enhances sales of meat substitutes, relative to both past sales in the experimental store and sales in eight other control stores that serve as benchmarks. No backfire effect was observed as meat product sales did not increase significantly. A follow-up study disentangles the effect of product visibility and pairwise presentation. Both product visibility and pairwise presentation increase sales of meat substitutes. However, when visibility is high, fewer meat substitutes were sold in a pairwise presentation.","Jolien Vandenbroele, Hendrik Slabbinck, Anneleen Van Kerckhove, Iris Vermeir",,,,,
33,"Horseshoes, hand grenades, and regulatory enforcement: Close experience with potential sanctions and fraud deterrence",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.obhdp.2019.09.001,24 September 2019,"We investigate the deterrence effect of experience with regulatory enforcement on fraud in a unique natural setting. Using ride-level data on New York City taxicab drivers, we identify drivers who fraudulently overcharge customers and pair them with the outcomes of drivers’ experience with regulatory enforcement (taxi court). We examine whether drivers’ experience with the taxi court, specifically whether the taxi court found them guilty or not guilty of fraud, affects their subsequent fraud. Interestingly, we find that the effect of experience with the regulatory enforcement on the likelihood of future fraud depends on the verdict received. Consistent with an impact bias in drivers’ affective forecasting, drivers who are found guilty (not guilty) are  () likely to commit fraud than similar drivers without recent taxi court experience. Our results have implications for academics and policymakers by showing that sometimes the threat of enforcement can be more effective at deterring future fraud than the actual enforcement itself.","Jeremy Douthit, Melanie Millar, Roger M.

34,Helping People by Being in the Present: Mindfulness Increases Prosocial Behavior,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.obhdp.2019.08.005,6 September 2019,"The present research tested whether mindfulness, a state characterized by focused, nonjudgmental awareness of the present moment, increases prosocial behavior in the workplace or work-related contexts. Study 1a was a longitudinal field experiment at a US insurance company. Compared to workers under waitlist control, employees who were assigned to a daily mindfulness training reported more helping behaviors over a five day period both in quantitative surveys and qualitative daily diaries. Study 1b, conducted in a large consulting company in India, extends these findings with a field experiment in which co-workers rated the prosocial behavior of teammates in a round robin design. Moving from devoting time to devoting money, in Studies 2a and 2b we find that individuals randomly assigned to engage in a focused breathing meditation were more financially generous. To understand the mechanisms of mindfulness’ effects on prosocial behavior, Study 3 found support for empathy and moderate support for perspective taking as mediators. This study also examined the effects of induced state mindfulness via two different mindfulness inductions, focused breathing and loving kindness meditation. Our results indicate that secular state mindfulness can make people more other-oriented and helpful. This benefit holds even in the workplace, where being helpful toward others might face constraints but is nevertheless of great importance.","Andrew C. Hafenbrack, Lindsey D. Cameron, Gretchen M.

35,The motivation of mission statements: How regulatory mode influences workplace discrimination,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.obhdp.2019.04.002,3 September 2019,"Despite concerted efforts to enforce ethical standards, transgressions continue to plague US corporations. This paper investigates whether the way in which an organization pursues its goals can influence ethical violations, manifested as involvement in discrimination. We test this hypothesis among franchises, which employ a considerable amount of low-income workers adversely affected by discrimination. Drawing upon Regulatory Mode Theory, we perform a linguistic analysis of franchise mission statements to determine their degree of  and  language. EEOC archival data for the past decade reveals that regulatory mode predicts franchise involvement in discrimination. Discriminatory behavior is associated with franchises whose mission statements motivate employees to embrace urgent action (locomotion mode) over thoughtful consideration (assessment mode). Two experiments demonstrate that participants exposed to high locomotion mission statements tend to disregard ethical standards due to their need for expediency, making significantly more discriminatory managerial decisions than those exposed to high assessment mission statements.","Dana Kanze, Mark A.

36,When weak sanctioning systems work: Evidence from auto insurance industry fraud investigations,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.obhdp.2019.04.003,30 May 2019,"To deter auto insurance fraud, insurance companies and law enforcement agencies investigate and prosecute suspicious claims. We describe this sanctioning system and perceptions of this system by integrating unique datasets: insurance company records, interviews with insurance fraud investigators, state law enforcement data (CA, NY), and surveys of automotive insurance customers. We identify organizational constraints, such as public relations concerns, that limit the effectiveness of the formal sanctioning system (fewer than 1% of claims that are flagged as suspicious are ever prosecuted for fraud). We also identify psychological factors that deter consumers from committing fraud; consumers over-estimate the probability of detection, over-estimate the consequences of prosecution, are sensitive to social sanctions (e.g., negative publicity), and anticipate high emotional costs, such as shame and embarrassment, that make the prospect of committing fraud highly aversive. That is, psychological factors substantially deter fraud even though the economic sanctions are weak. Our findings integrate scholarship on sanctioning systems (Tenbrunsel & Messick, 1991) and highlight the role of organizational constraints and psychological factors in deterring fraud.","Danielle E.

37,The demotivating effect (and unintended message) of awards,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.obhdp.2019.03.006,29 May 2019,"It is common for organizations to offer awards to motivate individual behavior, yet few empirical studies evaluate their effectiveness in the field. We report a randomized field experiment ( = 15,329) that tests the impact of two common types of symbolic awards: pre-announced awards (prospective) and surprise awards (retrospective). The context is U.S. schools, where we explore how awards motivate student attendance. Contrary to our pre-registered hypotheses and organizational leaders’ expectations, the prospective awards did not on average improve behavior, and the retrospective awards  subsequent attendance. Moreover, we find a significant negative effect on attendance after prospective incentives were removed, which points to a crowding-out effect. Survey experiments probing the mechanisms suggest that awards may cause these unintended effects by inadvertently signaling that the target behavior (perfect attendance) is neither the social norm nor institutionally expected. In addition, receiving the retrospective award suggests to recipients that they have already outperformed the norm and what was expected of them, hence licensing them to miss school. Exploratory analyses shed further light on differential effects of awards by age and performance.","Carly D. Robinson, Jana Gallus, Monica G. Lee, Todd Rogers",,,,,
38,Do status incentives undermine morality-based status attainment? Investigating the mediating role of perceived authenticity,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.obhdp.2019.04.005,17 May 2019,"We propose that status incentives weaken the relationship between moral behaviors and status conferral by undermining perceptions of authenticity. Across two experiments among diverse samples of participants, evidence indicates that observers question the authenticity of moral actors who are pursuing status incentives. Perceptions of authenticity mediate the interaction of moral behaviors and status incentives on status conferral. A third two-wave online survey replicates the experimental findings and reveals that observers’ moral identity further strengthens the interaction of moral behaviors and status incentives in shaping perceptions of authenticity and subsequent status conferral.","Feng Bai, Grace Ching Chi Ho, Wu Liu",,,,,
39,Humility breeds authenticity: How authentic leader humility shapes follower vulnerability and felt authenticity,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.obhdp.2019.04.008,7 May 2019,"Integrating existing work that considers the self through an interpersonal lens with theories pertaining to leader humility and authenticity, we develop a moderated mediation model that theorizes how and under what circumstances leader humility relates to follower felt authenticity. We argue that followers feel less vulnerable when their leaders express humility and further that this relation becomes weaker as the authenticity of leader humility decreases. We also theorize that follower vulnerability is the mechanism explaining the interactive effect of leader humility and its authenticity on follower felt authenticity at work. Our theoretical model was supported across four studies employing both correlational and experimental designs. These results contribute to our understanding of the interpersonal antecedents of authenticity at work as well as the growing body of research on the impact that leader humility has on important employee outcomes.","Burak Oc, Michael A.

We show that a standard (high-friction) opt-in process induces extremely low parent take-up (<1%), while a simplified process yields higher enrollment (11%). Yet, with such low take-up, both fail to improve average student achievement. Meanwhile, automatically enrolling parents increases take-up to 95% and improves student achievement as measured by GPA and course passing. The GPA of students whose parents were automatically enrolled increased by an average of 0.06 points, and one in four students did not fail a class they would have otherwise failed. Surveys show automatic enrollment is uncommon, and its impact is underestimated: District leaders  take-up under standard opt-in processes by about 40 percentage points and  take-up under automatic enrollment by 29 percentage points. After learning the actual take-up rates, district leaders report being willing to pay substantially more for the technology when implemented under automatic enrollment than by standard opt-in processes.","Peter Bergman, Jessica Lasky-Fink, Todd Rogers",,,,,
